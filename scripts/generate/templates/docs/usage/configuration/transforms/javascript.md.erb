## Data types correspondence

There is a one-to-one correspondence between each Vector's data type and a JavaScript type:

| Vector datatype | JavaScript datatype | Note |
|-----------------+---------------------+------|
| `Bytes`         | `String`            | Bytes sequences that are not valid UTF-8 are converted to UTF-8 in a lossy way |
| `Integer`       | [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)  | Attempt to return from JavaScript BigInt that is not between -2^63..2^63-1 will result in an error |
| `Float`         | `Number`            | Integers of form `123` without decimal point have type `Number` in JavaScript and will be convertd to `Float` when returned from JavaScript |
| `Boolean`       | `Boolean`           |      |
| `Timestamp`     | `Date`              | JavaScript dates precision is 1 millisecond, while Vector timestamps precision is 1 nanosecond |

## Options

<%= options_table(component.options.to_h.values.sort) %>

## Examples

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Add fields" %}
Add a root field to an event. Supply this as the `source` value:

```js
event => ({...event, field: 'value'})
```

Add a nested field to an event. Supply this as the `source` value:

```js
event => ({...event, ['nested.field']: 'value})
```

{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Remove fields" %}
Remove a field from an event. Supply this as the `source` value:

```js
event => ({...event, field: null})
```

Remove a nested field from an event. Supply this as the `source` value:

```js
event => ({...event, ['nested.field']: null})
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Drop event" %}
Drop an event entirely. Supply this as the `source` value:

```js
event => null
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Generate multiple events" %}
Generate multiple events from a single event. Supply this as the `source` value:

```js
event => [{...event, field1: 'value1'}, {...event, field2: 'value2'}]
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Set event timestamp" %}
Extract date encoded as UNIX timestamp from the message and set event timestamp from it.
Supply this as the `source` value:

```js
event => {
    const {created_at} = JSON.stringify(event.message)
    event.timestamp = new Date(created_at * 1000)
    return event
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Keep state between events" %}
Keep variables between processing subsequent events. These variables are recreated
if Vector is restarted.

Supply this as the `source` value:

```js
let count = 0
const handler = event => ({...event, count: ++count})
```

and set value of `handler` parameter to `handler`.
{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## How It Works [[sort]]

<%= component_sections(component) %>

Vector uses [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/quickjs.html) embedded
JavaScript engine for scripted transformations of the events. It implements
ECMAScript 2019 and parts of ECMAScript 2020.

Transformations are done using _handlers_. Handler is a user-defined
JavaScript function that takes one event object as input and outputs either of:

* Event: a JavaScript object with values of types `Boolean`, `Number`, `String`, or `Date`.
  If you need nested objects, use dot-separated key values, for example `a.b.c`.
* Null: if handler returns `null`, the event is discarded.
* Array: an array of event objects.

The handler code is specified in the `source` field of the transform config. If `handler`
parameter of the config is not specified, entire source should be a single function.

If `handler` parameter is specified, the source should contain a definition of the handler
function with the same name as the value of `handler`. In addition, the source can contain
other top-level functions, variables, constants, or classes. The value of `handler`
should consist of ASCII characters and be a valid JavaScript identifier.
